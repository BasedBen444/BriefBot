# Pricing Elasticity Deck — v3 (Markdown stand-in)

## Executive Summary (p.1)
- Baseline elasticity (consumer web): -1.3 (Q2 study); revised estimate Q3: -1.15 to -1.25.
- Competitors: AlphaSoft +2% (Sept), BetaWare 0%, MegaSuite +3% (Oct). 
- Our ASP drift: +0.4% YoY due to mix, not list changes.

## Elasticity Summary (p.4–6)
- Scenario A (0%): Projected volume: baseline; margin unchanged; lowest churn risk.
- Scenario B (+3%): Volume impact: -2.5% to -3.2%; net revenue +0.8% to +1.4% after churn.
- Scenario C (+5%): Volume impact: -5.0% to -6.0%; net revenue -0.5% to +0.3% depending on enterprise discounts.
- Sensitivity: Enterprise discounting erodes gains above +3% unless floors enforced.

## Competitor Moves (p.8)
- AlphaSoft: +2% list, held promo stack; minor churn in SMB.
- MegaSuite: +3% list, tightened partner rebates; enterprise renewals largely unaffected.
- BetaWare: held prices; increased bundling on add-ons.

## Risks / Trade-offs (p.10)
- Churn risk on price-sensitive SMBs
- Support ticket surge from mid-quarter change
- Channel friction if partner margins compressed

## Recommendation (p.12)
- Favor +3% with enterprise discount floor; re-evaluate in 60 days.

# Ops Constraints — Fulfillment & Systems

## Change Windows
- Code freeze: 2025-12-10 to 2025-12-15 (peak fulfillment window).
- Price file publish requires 48 hours notice to partners.

## Systems Notes
- Price propagation: web (12h), partner portal (24–36h), catalog PDF (weekly batch on Fridays).
- Mid-quarter change can create mixed pricing in tickets for ~24h.

## Risks
- Support load spike (FAQ updates needed).
- Partner margin compression at +5% unless rebates adjusted.

## Mitigations
- Publish at 2025-12-06 02:00 CT to avoid freeze overlap.
- Pre-brief support/CS; update macros and partner comms.
